            <p>Even when shopping online, there are benefits to buying locally. Importing a product from overseas may sometimes get you a cheaper deal, but it can also leave you vulnerable to several risks.
Here are a few reasons to buy new electronics and appliances from a business that deals only with local Australian distributors, rather than parallel or "grey" importers:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="information-box">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Complete consumer protection</h2>
            <p>Buying locally ensures that your purchases will be covered by their full manufacturer's warranty. If you ever have problems with your products, you can simply contact the retailer to quickly organise a repair or replacement from the manufacturer or locally-based distributor.</p>
            <p>Grey imports don't always provide local customer support, meaning that if anything goes wrong, you may need to contact the overseas manufacturer to organise the repair or replacement of your purchase, which can prove difficult, time-consuming and expensive.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="information-box">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Quality and safety</h2>
            <p>Locally-distributed electronics and appliances are required to comply with Australian Standards.  Even if they’re manufactured overseas, they're designed to be compatible with local power and/or water connections, ensuring that they’re simple and safe to use.</p>
            <p>Products from grey importers are not guaranteed to be compatible with Australian standards. They may require an international electricity adaptor (sold separately) to charge their battery, or may only have an international copy of their manual available. These products may be difficult to use properly, or even unsafe in an Australian home.
        </div>
        <div class="information-box">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">The genuine article</h2>
            <p>Even if you're shopping online and don't get to cast an eye over your electronics or appliances before you buy, you can be confident that you’ll get what you pay for when purchasing through an Australian retailer.</p>
            <p>When you buy a grey import, you can't always be certain that you're buying the genuine article. It's possible for some unethical resellers to place well-known branding on cheaper products to sell at inflated premium prices.
        </div>
        <div class="information-box">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Support your community</h2>
            <p>Shopping locally means that the money you spend can go back into the jobs, businesses and services that make up the Australian economy.</p>
            <p>By bypassing Australian distributors, the majority of the money from your purchase goes overseas, where it can’t help support your friends, neighbours and loved ones.</p>
